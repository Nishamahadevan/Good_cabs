project outline for "GoodCabs - Transportation and Operation Analysis"

GoodCabs, a mid-sized ride-hailing company operating in multiple metropolitan cities, was facing operational inefficiencies, increasing customer complaints, and rising costs. With growing competition and customer expectations, it was crucial for GoodCabs to assess its transportation and operational strategies to maintain market share and improve profitability.

The objective was to conduct a comprehensive Transportation and Operation Analysis of GoodCabs to:

Identify bottlenecks in fleet utilization, routing, and driver availability.

Analyze trip data to understand customer behavior, peak demand periods, and underperforming zones.

Optimize dispatch and routing algorithms.

Recommend cost-saving strategies while improving service efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Data Collection & Cleansing:

Gathered historical ride data, driver availability logs, and customer feedback.

Cleaned and structured the data for analysis.

Operational Analysis:

Performed route efficiency analysis using GIS and location data.

Evaluated driver performance metrics and idle time.

Identified high-demand and low-service areas.

Transportation Modeling:

Used simulation and predictive modeling to forecast demand and fleet requirements.

Analyzed vehicle dispatch efficiency and rebalancing needs.

Stakeholder Interviews:

Conducted discussions with drivers, operations managers, and support teams to identify pain points.

Optimization Recommendations:

Proposed dynamic pricing during peak hours and optimized shift scheduling.

Suggested AI-based route optimization to reduce fuel consumption and wait times.

Developed a centralized dashboard for real-time operations monitoring.

Result:

Reduced average wait time by 20% and increased trip completion rate by 15%.

Operational costs dropped by 12% through improved fleet utilization.

Customer satisfaction scores increased by 18% within three months post-implementation.

The company adopted several data-driven operational changes, leading to better scalability and performance in new cities.
